Welcome/VelkomiÃ°! I'm Greg... ðŸ§”

I'm obsessed with code (mainly PowerShell ðŸ¤—ðŸ¥°ðŸ˜‹) and automating anything and everything!

```powershell
$aboutMe = @(

  'Senior Systems/DevOps Engineer',

  'Automation and PowerShell enthusiast',

  'Fantasy/Norse Lore geek',

  'Foodie (Pub food and a dark lager or brown ale will do!)'

)
```

## Why am I here?

Good question! Well, hopefully great minds think alike and you landed at my Blog's front door whilst browsing the web and thinking...  
* I could really use some nifty new PowerShell scripts and tips to hopefully make my life and the lives of those I care about a little easier.  
* A kick ass braised sausages and gravy recipe...  
* I think it may be time to incorporate some automation into your ~~current~~ antiquated infrastructure stacks?  

Well then...

```powershell
if (Get-Content .\any\ofthe\aforementionedStatements.md) {
    Start-Process ReadOn.exe
}
```
