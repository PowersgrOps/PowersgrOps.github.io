I am currently a Senior Systems/DevOps Engineer living outside of Boston, Massachusetts for one of the biggest video game developers on the East Coast. My day-to-day includes a balance of monitoring and maintaining our various infrastructure stacks as well as always looking for ways to improve and build upon them. As is it, this means that a good portion of my time is spent developing, building, and testing potential solutions and improvements. And while my time in IT has not been the stuff of legend, I have spent the last 5 years or so learning and developing myself in the areas of automation for both On-premises and Cloud platforms, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery, and adopting DevOps practices. I have learned much along my journey thus far and I owe a good portion of that knowledge gained to those who have generously volunteered their time to develop the illuminative and thoughtful documentation that has helped bring me to this point in my life and career. I only hope to continue to learn and grow and share my experiences with you! And the goal of developing this blog is a testament to just that...

Outside of work, I like to make the most of my time by spending it with my family. I am the lucky husband to a wonderful wife and proud father of our two boys. Everything I have become over the years, I owe to them. They are my "**why**" that continues to encourage me to better myself professionally and as a father and husband. I love you all more than you will ever know.

Other than that, my pastimes include:
* **Food!**  
    - I love all types of food, but Pub food and a good beer remain supreme. Cooking has rapidly become one of my main hobbies over the past couple of years.  
* **Sports!**  
    - More specifically, combat sports. And even more specifically, the _UFC_. This coupled with attempting to put together a winning _DraftKings_ lineup is how I spend most Saturday nights.  
* **Gaming!**  
    - I like a variety of games, but admittedly most of my virtual time is spent on the continent of Tamriel, in the popular MMO, _The Elder Scrolls Online_. When I am not laying waste to cultist evangelists, various ghouls and goblins or the undead, I'm attempting to theorycraft characters abilities and gear stats in the hopes of coming up with some new, game changing build for the ESO community. I will let you know when that happens... ðŸ¤¨  
* **Reading/Audible!**  
    - Recently, _Audible_ has changed my life! Some of my favorites would include _The Hobbit_, _Neil Gaiman's Norse Mythology_, anything by _Joe Abercrombie_ or narrated by _Steven Pacey_.  
* And most recently, creating and developing this blog!


# Sounds great! But why am I here?

Good question! Well, hopefully great minds think alike, and you landed on my blog's front door whilst browsing the web and thinking...  
* I could really use some nifty new PowerShell logic to hopefully make my life and the lives of those I care about a little easier.  
* I would love a beer-braised sausages and onion gravy recipe! ðŸ¤¤  
* It may be time to incorporate some automation development and testing into my ~~current~~ antiquated infrastructure stacks?  
* How do I develop PowerShell modules? And if so, how can I incorpate DevOps practices in said module development with testing and continuous integration?  

Well, you are in luck friend! Moving forward, my goal is to continue developing this blog by putting together various posts detailing the answers to the questions above and much more!  

I cannot thank you enough for being here and please make sure to reach out if you have any questions/concerns or just to say hello!
