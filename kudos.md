Within my **[About](https://powersgrops.github.io/about/)** I mentioned how I owe a good portion of my knowledge gained to various individuals/groups who have generously given their time and effort to create and share some kick-ass content. And I would most certainly be remiss if I did not give credit where credit was due. Below, you will find a hodgepodge of honorable mentions to a variety of people who have helped me along this journey in one way or another. From the amazing Engineers/Admins/Devs that have helped me grow in my career over the years, to creative content from others I have used to help build this blog site, I want to share my gratitude for all your hard work and efforts...

**Alex Kunchevsky**

Admittedly, I do not know a damn thing about Alex (and I would imagine, ditto) except that he has created some really cool creative content. Some of which I have used on this blog site! If you happened to notice the seemingly indifferent bearded programmer GIF on my **[About](https://powersgrops.github.io/about/)**, you are now a witness to my animated doppelganger... But more importantly, you are also a bit more familiar with Alex's work. Head over to **[Dribble](https://dribbble.com/kunchevsky/about)** to learn more about Alex!
